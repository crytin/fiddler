## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
 One of the few challenges while creating this submission was getting used to the new language. At first, I was very intimidated by the angle brackets. But as I worked on the project more, I was able to visualize the angle brackets in my head. I started thinking of them as a box and what type of box it was. This helped me to understand the buttons, head, and body of the HTML file. In addition, I started to notice that the syntax was starting very similar to C++. The more I worked on the project the less challenging it got. The document was helpful in that it provided separate documentation of the functions mentioned. I was able to learn the roles of HTML, CSS, and JS. This was my first time coding in this environment and I was able to get through it pretty well.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
 One question I have about web development is how many factors do web developers need to consider for publishing a website. One example would be different phone sizes or the performance of different computers. I know that websites that have a lot of features require a lot of assets and having a slow computer can take a long time to load these assets or features. How do web developers optimize certain features on a site for different users? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
 If I had a few more hours on this project, I would add a different songs from Fiddler on the Roof from different instruments. After completing one song, I would play another to see if the user notices. In addition, I would change the button's sound to fit the style of the instrument I want the song to be played in. As for an Easter egg, if the user is able to complete all of the songs, the user would uncover an actual Fiddler on the Roof!
